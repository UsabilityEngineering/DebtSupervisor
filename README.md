# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* Looked at competitors apps to get an idea of where to start to provide insight on what to do and not to do
* Devised potential users and scenarios that would lead users to using our application 
* Examined heuristics and how they were implemented in competitors and how they could be implemented into our own
* Made some rough sketches and outlines of what the app could could look like for users
* Programmed some buttons and other simple functions to work since we are in the early stages there are only a few functions 
  1. to add a new debt to the application
  2. Added tiles for the user to see from the homepage this will display how much they owe and how much is left
  3. Added a home button to the application
