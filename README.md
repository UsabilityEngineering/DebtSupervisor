# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* Looked at competing apps to know what was missing and where to begin.
* Examined heuristics and how they were implemented in competitors and how they could be implemented into our own.
* Devised potential userbase and scenarios that would lead users to our application.
* Produced low-fidelity models of what the app could look like for users.
* Programmed buttons and other simple functions onto a prototype including the following:
  1. Function to add a new debt to the application
  2. Added tiles for the user to see from the homepage this will display how much they owe and how much is left
  3. Added an account feature to separate allow for multiple users.
