# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

With there being a lot of people in debt. We as a team have decided to make an application for the users to keep track of the debt that they owe. Now we are aware that there are others on the market but we plan on making an open source web-based application for users. This is a well needed application because it helps users plan and save accordingly. There are a lot of things going on and everybody's day-to-day life so to have an application that helps you keep track of everything will help out greatly.

## Methods

One of the methods that we use to discover new insights was downloading other popular apps from the app store. Since it was really easy to go to the app store type in debt applications we had a list to go through. We just chose from the top three applications that the store had to offer. From there we did an evaluation to see what we liked and didn't like. When we went through evaluating different points of the apps we were able to see what apps were better than others. Most importantly we were able to see what we wanted to do with our app. This really did give great insight into where we wanted to go with our debt application.

Another one of the things that we did in order to do some more research for the application was make some personas. With these personas we made small characters that we put them in different scenarios. With these personas and their scenarios we basically had a fictional person that we could think of to design our application for. Now with this persona we had small details about them. These details were stuff like their hobbies, age range and most importantly their goals for what they wanted to do in the app. When we had all of this together it helped illustrate a person that would possibly use her app.

Finally the last thing that we did was do some hand-drawn sketches for the user interface. They are very simple pencil and paper outlines for what a rough outline of the application should look like. This outline was done with just a pencil for ease of use and quick fixing and redrawing. Accusing this method was very simple and easy to do and was a good way to outline and get a feel of what it could possibly look like. Then we also made multiple pages for what interactions might look like page by page. To give an idea of what different pages might look like inside the app.

## Findings

With our first method we used heuristic evaluation
- We saw that there are too many pages just to set up the app
- There were many apps but none of them were simple to use
- In some of the apps it was difficult to find the delete button
- Some of the apps had too much clutter and data just in the user's face making it much too cluttered

With our next method we started to think about the users needs
- The need to be able to add not only debt but possible savings or future spendings
- The idea of being able to quickly add new debts without having to put a lot of information in
- Being able to access the app without internet

Lastly we were able to get an idea for the user interface
- Again make sure it is easy to see debts and simple to use
- Make sure the add new debt button is easy to find and see
- Make sure it is easy to find the delete to clear up any mistakes 


## Conclusions

First, with the method that we use to get more information and start on the project there are some limitations. One of the biggest problems is the fact that we do not have any real users for the app. The personas are only implied and not real so we do not have their feedback since they're not real. We can only think about intended uses and how they should work from our perspective. When doing this we can only think of what the user will do as their possible outcome. It is a good starting point but without user feedback makes it impossible to really know what is going on. Although there is a problem we were able to come up with a few new functions for the application. With this we were able to come up with the idea of making sure the application can be used offline. To most people this would be beneficial to not have to be required to have internet access once the app is downloaded. 

After that we have the heuristic evaluation we did then this helped us see that most of the apps ask for too much information. This was a help for our overall design. Since there are so many apps on the market we need to make sure we stand out. By standing out and making sure that the user sees what they're looking for is very important. When you are looking at the app we would like to display the most current up-to-date information. Most of the other apps had a lot of unused information that the user easily just skipped over. This can lead me to the idea that having a simple interface is much more important and the overall debt that they owe at a glance would be a step in the right direction.

Finally with our sketches that we did we can see how the user might interact. The first thing that was done in our mock sketches was button placement. When the user has easy access to the buttons and they are in a familiar place it makes the app much easier to use. When drawing out the outline for the application putting an emphasis on button placement and easy to click on icons. Buttons play a very important role in ease of use for the user experience. When there are well labeled buttons and simple to follow pages it makes the flow much easier. After making the sketches it was apparent that we should add a home button that's always in the application page. Most apps have some sort of home button so it would feel familiar to most. I have one in the app.


## Caveats

One of the considerations that must be made is about the personas and how everything is an assumption. As previously stated, since they are not real people all their interactions will be assumed. Planning the uses is a good way to get some ideas using a persona. Although this is a good start it is still not perfect.

Following that another problem is when we did the heuristic evaluation we only used applications found in Mobile web stores. This can provide great insight to competitors and what's good and bad for each app. The main problem with this is we only used one source instead of using other places. We could have possibly used more sources like web-based applications. This would greatly help to white in our scope and see more ideas.

Finally the last problem we could have is with our sketches. Since we all worked independently on them we all had different ideas for the base of the application. We should have talked to the team and had started working on a web-based design. At the time we did not know that's what they were programming for but this would have been better to be more closer to what they're doing. Another problem with the sketches is they might be hard to read or understand. This could lead to problems with interpretation in the app's layout.
