# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

With there being a lot of people in debt, we as a team have decided to make an application for users to keep track of what they owe. W are aware that there are similar applications on the market, but we plan on making an open source, web-based application for users. This is a much needed application because it helps users plan and save accordingly. In day-to-day life, keeping track of expenses and debt can be inconvenient. An application that keeps track of these things will help out greatly.

## Methods

One of the methods that we use to discover new insights was downloading other popular apps from the app store. There were many apps similar which were advertised to do similar things as our own. We chose from the top three applications that the store had to offer and proceeded to evaluate them against a list of user experience heuristics and design principles. We did an evaluation to see where and how they applied. We were able to see what apps were better than others. Most importantly, we were able to see what these apps lacked. This gave us much needed insight into where we wanted to go with our debt application.

Another method we employed was the use of personas and scenarios. Personas were fictional people that we could thought of to design our application for. We included many small details, including their hobbies, age range, and, most importantly, their goals for what they wanted to do in the app. These goals were often presented in the form of a scenario. These scenarios were little anecdotes that could happen in real life. The main point of the scenario was to outline the personas goal. With all of this together, it helped illustrate a person that would possibly use our app.

Finally, we created some hand-drawn sketches for the user interface. They are very simple pencil and paper outlines for what a rough outline of the application should look like. This outline was done with these materials for ease of use and quick fixing. We also made multiple pages for what interactions might look like page by page. 

## Findings

With our first method we used heuristic evaluation
- We saw that there are too many pages just to set up the app
- There were many apps, but none of them were simple to use
- In some apps, it was difficult to find simple items such as the delete button
- Some apps had too much clutter and data just in the user's face making it overwhelming for first time users

With our next method we started to think about the users needs
- The need to be able to add not only debt but possible savings or future spendings
- The idea of being able to quickly add new debts without having to put a lot of information in
- Being able to access the app without internet

Lastly, we were able to get an idea for the user interface
- Make sure it is easy to see debts and spending
- Make sure the add new debt button is easy to find and see
- Make sure it is easy to find, delete, and clear up any mistakes 


## Conclusions

Through our research into competitors, were able to see what they did well and where they fell. These weaknesses allowed us to come up with a new functions for our application to separate itself from others. We were able to come up with the idea of making sure the application can be used offline. Most if not all of the competing applications required internet connection. To many people, it would be beneficial to not have to be required to have internet access once the app is downloaded.

After that, we performed a heuristic evaluation on potential competitor. This helped us see that most of the apps asked for too much information and personal data. This was a help for our overall design as there are so many apps on the market we need to make sure we stand out. We wanted to make sure that the user sees what they're looking for. When looking at the app, users would like to display the most current up-to-date information. Most of the apps had a lot of miscellaneous information and advertisements that the users needed to skip over. This can lead to the idea that having a simple interface is much more important and the overall debt that they owe at a glance would be a step in the right direction. A simple user interface would be the best fit with no pop-ups or requests of personal information.

Finally, with our sketches we were able to see how the user might interact with the app. The first thing that was done in our mock sketches was button placement. When the user has easy access to the buttons and they are in a familiar place it makes the app much easier to use. When drawing out the outline for the application, we placed an emphasis on button placement and easy-to-click icons. Buttons play a very important role in ease of use for the user experience. When there are well labeled buttons and simple to follow pages it makes the flow much easier. After making the sketches it was apparent that we should add a home button that's always in the application page. Most apps have some sort of home button so it would feel familiar to most.


## Caveats

One of the considerations that must be made is about the personas and how everything is an assumption. The method that we used to gather information and start the project had some limitations. One of the biggest problems is the fact that we do not have any real users for the app. The personas are only implied and not real so we do not have their feedback since they're not real. We can only think about intended uses and how they should work from our perspective. These biases could cloud our perception of its ease of use. While it is a good starting point, without actual user feedback, using personas and scenarios make impossible to really know how accessible the app is. 

Following that another problem is when we did the heuristic evaluation we only used applications found in Mobile web stores. This can provide great insight to competitors and what's good and bad for each app. The main problem with this is we only used one source instead of using other places. We could have possibly used more sources like web-based applications. This would greatly help to white in our scope and see more ideas.

Finally the last problem we could have is with our sketches. Since we all worked independently on them we all had different ideas for the base of the application. We should have talked to the team and had started working on a web-based design. At the time we did not know that's what they were programming for but this would have been better to be more closer to what they're doing. Another problem with the sketches is they might be hard to read or understand. This could lead to problems with interpretation in the app's layout.
