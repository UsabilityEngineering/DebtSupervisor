# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

We are trying to help people track their debt and to see where their money goes. There are often people that are really busy in their day to day lives so having an app to watch their spending will help them to watch where their spending goes.

## Methods

One of the things we did in this sprint was a cognitive walkthrough with some input from other UX design teams. This was the way that we were able to get some outside help to see where we can improve the overall features of our website. We gave the other team access to one of our prototypes of our webpage. 

Our prototype was a wireframe, a really low effort outline that was made. This was just all in black and white to give an outline of what the website could look like. This was made with some interactivity for the user to click on buttons to then go and feel like a real webpage for the user to explore.

When you do a walkthrough it's as if you are the persona from the list that we made from phase one. When you have one picked out you then can use one of the scenarios to then act as if you are them. After that then you can begin your walkthrough. It will be as if you are that user. Make sure you take good notes to then go step by step to show what you did at every transaction with the prototype. Like for example when you got to the home page after making a new account then you write down what did the site show you and what were your ideas on what to do next. Then from there the user then keeps using the site till they can complete their original task that they set out to do from the beginning. All the step by step will help us later to see what they did and where there are problems on the site. After that then they can also give us additional comments for us to take a look at.

## Findings

Here is what the users had to say about their walkthroughs when they used the prototype.


There were two of the users that were having some problem deleting the entries in their debut web page. We then realized we forgot to have some way for the user to delete their debt entries in a quick and easy manner. From there we were able to realize that and fix that for the next prototype. 

Then the next problem that we had from the walkthroughs was that there was no way for the user to save the data locally. Then we thought about this one since it is a web app. Although this is a great concern we came to the conclusion that it is a web app then we really can't have a way to save since it is a web app.

## Conclusions

The biggest part of the feedback we got from the other team was that there was no way to delete the debt once you have added it. This is a very important part of the basic features that we totally forgot about. Now that they pointed it out to us we quickly took note and then added that to the items to fix. This was highlighted by two of the users that were doing a walkthrough of our prototype. 

Then when we were able to get some more feedback on the overall design and the coimments were for sure overall positive. The feedback was that the site was easy to use and has all the basic functions that every other site has as well. This was a relief since we did use a very simple and very common approach to layout. Since then we really did not have any problems with the user experience on the site so we decided to keep it the same. Using the logic that since there were no compl;ants or real problems on the site then we should be fine for that being the overall layout.

## Caveats

The main problem that we  have with making the users do when walkthough is that they are all acting as if they were the persona. This is bad since it's limited to what we have done and thought about so then that's very limited for sure. The biggest problem is that they are not the user in the walk through they are only acting as such. This can be where they can just infer on what the site does, insisting on really being in the situation. Then this makes the feedback not as strong since we do not know how a real user would act. 

Next problem is that we only had one real demographic for the users that were doing the walk though this made it really one sided. When you are doing the walk though you need many different scenarios and demographics to make sure your website can fit a wide variety of people. When you do this you are better set to the real world. When we looked at the feedback they were all really in the same direction of what happened. This really proves that doing this walkthrough was informative but to a point.
