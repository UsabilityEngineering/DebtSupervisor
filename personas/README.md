**John Johnson**

*20 Year Old Male in Sunbridge, Florida*

Student at Sunbridge University; studying for their Bachelor Degree in Cryptozoology
Johnson is a busy student. His weekdays are filled with classes and study sessions. On his
weekends, he likes to unwind from modern society and take hikes away from society. He lives
alone in a single room dormitory.
Johnson's busy schedule means that he doesn't have time to keep track of things outside his
studies and hobbies. He is also a more outdoorsy person, so he is not very tech savvy and is
often without internet.

Goals:
-  Have a simple, accessible interface
-  Keep track of multiple debts
-  Work while offline/ without internet

# Scenarios

- **John** has realized that he has taken unsubsidized student loans. The first payment is due
during Summer Break, which is during his big 2-month long camping expedition. He will be
without internet access so no application can give him a notification while he's away. This
means he will need to keep track of his monthly dues so that he knows when to return to town
so that he doesn't miss any payments.

- **Dave** was able to get a big bonus from work and now is thinking about what to do with the
money that he has just gotten in front of him so he is now tasked with taking his family out to a
family trip or should they stay home and save the money and pay the bills or even can just save
a part of it and use the rest for home use
Then he is good at managing money but when you get unexpected amount it seems like extra

- **Dave** wants to go to a audio convention in a few months and is been thinking about it for a while
now since he has never been to one then he does have a weekend open to be able to go out to
it would be a dream come true but he is not sure how he can make the payment or be able to
save up enough in time to get a ticket
