# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

For this project, we sought to create a website which would allow users to track their spending and debt in one convenient location. In previous sprints, we created the foundation for it's functions and prototypes for its layout. For this sprint, we focused on actual user testing. We prepared the proper forms to that we could legally test the UX prototype with people. We hoped to gather actual user feedback to see what we could improve on the website.

## Methods

For our user test, we gathered 5 participants to run through the prototype of our website. We made certain to get their expressed permission to participate through signing informed consent forms. We would then have the user sit in front of our prototype on a computer which was recording the screen and their inputs. We would then begin the test.

We first created a user test protocol to guide our testing so that it would remain consistent. It began with us asking users about their experience with similar websites and applications. We asked them whether they had used other apps which aided them in debt supervision and how their experience with them has been.

We then listed tasks that participants would attempt to complete. These tasks were similar to the scenarios which personas would run through to use our website. These included account creation, adding and removing debt, and reviewing their account information. We had to make certain that the wording of each task did not include elements from the actual prototype.Whether the participants were able to complete the task or not, we would take notes on their navigation through the site and the steps taken towards the task’s completion. 

After all tasks were completed, we would take some closing thoughts from the participant. These included aspects of the navigation, design, and satisfaction. We gave users the opportunity to discuss features that they would like to have in our site.

We would then thank them for their time and allow them to leave.

## Findings

We found that most users have used applications to track their spending and debt. They did so for a myriad of reasons, including tracking subscriptions, tracking spending, and setting budgets. All users who did so only used their banking app. These included Bank of America. US Bank, and Chevron. The features that they enjoyed most from these apps were the ability to group transactions, automatic spending monitoring, and pop-out notifications.

We found that all users were able to complete the tasks given to them in our protocol with relative ease. On a scale of ease of use, with 1 being ‘very difficult-’ and 5 being ‘very easy,’ all scores were a 5 with the exception of one 4. The one 4 was due to a minor confusion in design. Participant 2 was tasked with deleting a transaction. He stated that “the ‘x’ button(delete button) blended in with the background.” Aside from this all users were able to very easily create their accounts, manage their transactions, review their account, and log out of their account. 

We then asked for their closing thoughts. 

For what they liked, Participant 1 enjoyed that it “emphasized the need to make [an] account” when you first visit the site. Participant 3 stated that “the green add and red cancel buttons matched with my mental model.” They referred to how a stoplight and other sites use similar colors for stopping and proceeding. Participant 4 enjoyed the big font size so that everything was clear. 

Users also shared their dislikes about the site. Participant 1 noted that the design was rather plain. They did note that they were “unsure if we really needed a visually stimulating design for a debt app.” As mentioned previously Participant 2 stated that the delete button blended with the background.

For their overall thoughts, users enjoyed the clean design of the site. Participant 2 stated that they “liked how it was simple in function and simple in design.” 

## Conclusions

Through our findings it is clear that the site is easily traversed. Users were able to complete tasks in short amounts of time resulting in quick testing. This means that the site map is well designed.

Participants were given a chance to recommend functions or changes to the site at the end of the test. All of these involved aspects of the design of the website. 

Participant 1 did not have any changes to recommend. His only dislike of the site was that it was rather plain with him noting that most debt sites were similarly plain. We could consider adding in some design aspect so long as it still has a tone of professionalism. 

Participant 2 noted that the x blended in with the background. We could fix this by having the delete button within a red square so that it stands out from the white background.

Participant 3 noted that the multicolored headers were not visually appealing to them. We could change this by making them the same color, so long as it retains its professionalism. 

Participant 4 suggested that we could add more options for customization and personalization. At the moment, users have the ability to add a picture. We could include granting users the ability to group debts and change their colors on the budget wheel. We could also add personalization through a custom background uploaded to their account similar to how profile pictures are. 

Participant 5 was a fan of the font size, but he also recommended a different font. There are many fonts to choose from which would still retain the tone of professionalism in our website. However, we do have to keep in mind that we need it to be just as easily readable as our current font.

## Caveats

When researching to improve our website, some caveats arose due to the scope of our project.

First, when we created our user test protocol, we did so with the assumption that participants have had experience with tracking debt. Some people have never had the need to track their spending as their finances are managed by others such as their parents. Without prior experience or knowledge, many of the words and tasks in our protocol would be foreign concepts.

Another limitation in our testing is our smaller demographic. Our testing demographic was 5 students from the University of California, Chico. This is a small sample size of a particular demographic, which we can not draw too many assumptions on. Our potential user base may include many others, such those outside of college, senior citizens, and full-time workers. We were unable to get input from these groups so we can not assume that our website is easy to use or visually appealing from just 5 students.

Finally, we were unable to use the actual functioning website as our prototype. This means that, while the UX prototype tested favorably, we cannot be certain how it will be once we merge with the actual functioning website.
